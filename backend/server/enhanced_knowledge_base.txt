## 1. Crop Diseases: Identification and Control

### Leaf Spot Diseases
- **Symptoms**: Yellow haloed round or irregular spots on leaves, spindled-shaped on rice. defoliation.
- **Organic Control**: Crop rotation, proper spacing, removal of infected plant debris.
- **Chemical Control**: Copper-based fungicides, Carbendazim sprays.

### Powdery Mildew
- **Symptoms**: White, powdery patches on leaves and stems. Leaves may dry and curl. Common in warm, humid weather.
- **Control**: Resistant varieties, sulfur-based fungicides, ensuring good aeration.

### Rust Diseases (Yellow, Stem, Brown)
- **Symptoms**: Reddish-brown, orange, or black pustules on stems and leaves. Leads to lodging and drying.
- **Control**: Crop rotation, removal of volunteer plants, application of Propiconazole or Tebuconazole.

### Bacterial Blights & Wilts
- **Symptoms**: Water-soaked lesions, sudden wilting, necrotic ulcers (Fire blight), or yellowing.
- **Control**: Streptomycin sulfate sprays, copper bactericides, use of disease-free seeds, hot water seed treatment (50°C for 20 mins).

### Mosaic Viruses
- **Symptoms**: Mottling, distortion, curling of leaves, stunted growth. Transmitted by vectors like whiteflies and aphids.
- **Control**: Controlling insect vectors (using Neem oil or Dimethoate), using resistant varieties, destroying infected plants.

### Rice Blast (Magnaporthe grisea)
- **Symptoms**: Spindle-shaped spots with grey centers. Neck rot causes panicles to break.
- **Control**: Integrated management, avoiding excess nitrogen, seed treatment with Thiram.

### Sugarcane Red Rot
- **Symptoms**: Withering of canes, purple/red pith with white mycelium, disagreeable odor.
- **Control**: Healthy sett selection, pre-treatment with hot water, avoid alkaline soils.

## 2. Irrigation Methods and Efficiency

### Drip Irrigation (Efficiency: 80-95%)
- **Mechanism**: Water applied slowly directly to root zone via emitters.
- **Benefits**: Saves 35-50% water vs flood irrigation. Reduces weeds, labor, and enables fertigation. Best for high-value crops like grapes, pomegranate, and bananas.

### Sprinkler Irrigation (Efficiency: 60-80%)
- **Mechanism**: Sprays water into the air to simulate rain.
- **Benefits**: Good for sandy soils and uneven terrain. Best for wheat, maize, and groundnut. Not recommended for tall crops or hot windy areas due to evaporation.

### Traditional Surface Irrigation (Efficiency: 30-50%)
- **Types**: Basin, furrow, and flood irrigation.
- **Problems**: High water wastage, waterlogging, soil salinization risk.

## 3. Crop Recommendations & Nutrient Management

### Soil pH and Nutrient Availability
- **Acidic Soil (< 6.5)**: Low availability of P, K, Ca, Mg. May need liming.
- **Neutral Soil (6.5-7.5)**: Ideal for most crops. High nutrient efficiency.
- **Alkaline Soil (> 7.5)**: Low availability of Fe, Mn, Zn, B. May need gypsum or sulfur application.

### Major Nutrients (NPK)
- **Nitrogen (N)**: Crucial for leafy growth. Deficiency causes overall yellowing.
- **Phosphorus (P)**: Essential for root development and flowering. Deficiency causes purplish leaves.
- **Potassium (K)**: Vital for disease resistance and fruit quality. Deficiency causes scorched leaf edges.

### Recommendation Logic
- **High Rainfall (> 1100mm)**: Rice, Jute, Coconut.
- **Moderate Rainfall (600-1100mm)**: Maize, Cotton, Sugarcane, Pulses.
- **Low Rainfall (< 600mm)**: Pearl Millet (Bajra), Sorghum (Jowar), Chickpea.

## 4. Fertilizer Recommendations for Major Indian Crops

### General NPK Guidelines (kg/acre)
- **Rice**: 40-60 N, 15-20 P, 15-20 K. Split Nitrogen: 50% at transplanting, 25% at tillering, 25% at panicle initiation.
- **Wheat**: 50 N, 25 P, 15 K. Apply Phosphorus and Potassium at sowing. Nitrogen in 2-3 splits during irrigation.
- **Maize**: 60 N, 30 P, 20 K. Requires Zinc (ZnSO4 - 10kg/acre) for high yield.
- **Cotton**: 40-50 N, 20-25 P, 15-20 K. 
- **Sugarcane**: 100-120 N, 30-40 P, 30-40 K. High requirement for Nitrogen and organic manure (FYM).
- **Pulses (Chickpea, Lentil)**: 10-15 N (Low requirement due to N-fixation), 20-30 P, 15 K.

### Micronutrient Management
- **Zinc Deficiency**: Khaira disease in rice. Apply 10kg/acre Zinc Sulfate.
- **Iron Deficiency**: Common in high pH (alkaline) soils. Foliar spray of Ferrous Sulfate (0.5%).
- **Boron Deficiency**: Causes hollowing in cauliflower and poor fruit set in tomatoes. Apply Borax (4-5kg/acre).
